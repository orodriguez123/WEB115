    <h2>Easy to upgrade parts</h2>
    <p>You could say the same thing about a retail computer but an issue arises by just adding in more ram or even a new part the isnt from the coure of the manufacturer they could decline your warranty if you have any issues. This can be an issue even if a different component goes bad that isnt even involved with the parts you added. However buy your own parts you are more likly to pick higher quality parts and will have a warrenty for every one of you parts.</p>

    <p>Near the end of 2014 I started to get into PC games but at the time I was playing on an old hp pavilion 17 that was not the PC for gaming. I then started to look around on the internet for pc and saw that they were pretty expensive of they had part/ brand that I didnt like.</p>
